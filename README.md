# NeuralNetwork
Free library that provides a neural network mathematical model. (unlicensed)

## Library description

It provides the neural network mathematical model. This library is developed to be used to simulate a non-linear system, previously identified through a specific neural network training system. The NeuralNetwork library is developed in Modelica 2.2 and it offers all the required capabilities to create and use different kinds of neural networks. Currently, only the feed-forward, the elman and the radial basis neural network can be modeled and simulated, but it is possible to develop other kinds of neural network models using the basic elements provided by the library.
