NeuralNetwork Modelica library.

## Library description

The NeuralNetwork library is developed in Modelica 4.0 and offers dense
feed-forward artificial neural network structures in pure Modelica.

## Example

Modelica model `NeuralNetwork.Examples.HelloWorld` replace polynomial Modelica
equation

$$ f: [-1, 1] \to \mathbb{R}, f(u) = u^2 + 0.5 u - 2  $$

with a dense feed forward neural network with one input and one output layer.

The training of the neural network is done with
[TensorFlow][tensorflow-link]. Training and export to Modelica is
showcased in Jupyter notebook
[Example/helloWorld.ipynb][example-link].

## Current release

[Version 2.1.0][release-link]

## License

This package is licensed under the [3-Clause BSD License][license].

## Development and contribution

The development is organized by
[Hochschule Bielefeld â€“ University of Applied Sciences and Arts, Faculty of Engineering and Mathematics][hsbi-link].

This package is based on [NeuralNetwork v1.0 (2006-04-28)][nn-v1-link].

### Build Python packages

[PythonToModelica][python-package] is a Python package to help exporting
artificial neural networks from Python to Modelica and used in
[Example/helloWorld.ipynb][example-ipynb]. See [README.md][python-readme] for
build instructions.
